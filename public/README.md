## Important: Add Your CV

Please add your CV PDF file here as `cv.pdf`.

The Resume section of your website includes a download button that links to `/cv.pdf`, which will serve this file.

## File Structure

```
public/
├── cv.pdf          <-- Add your CV here

```

## Other Static Assets

You can also place other static files in this directory:
- Favicons
- Images
- Documents
- Any other static files that need to be publicly accessible

All files in this directory will be served from the root URL path.
For example, `public/cv.pdf` will be accessible at `https://your-domain.com/cv.pdf`
